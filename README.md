# IBM-Python-Project-for-DS

This is a project on Data Visualization of stock data as part of the curriculum for [IBM python project for Data Science Course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-project-for-data-science?specialization=ibm-data-science) on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/).

## Project Overview

Python is a major programming language in the Data Science Ecosystem. This project aims to evaluate the learner's understanding of the Python essentials especially in a Data Science oriented environment. The project uses [yfinance](https://pypi.org/project/yfinance/), [Requests](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and [Beautiful Soup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/) for data extraction, [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.html) for data cleaning, and [Plotly](https://plotly.com/python/) for data visualization.

The tasks covered are:

1. Defining a Function that Makes a Graph given a pandas dataframe.
1. Using [yfinance](https://pypi.org/project/yfinance/) to Extract Stock Data
2. Using Webscraping to Extract Tesla Revenue Data.
3. Using [yfinance](https://pypi.org/project/yfinance/) to Extract Stock Data.
4. Using Webscraping to Extract GME Revenue Data.
5. Plotting Tesla Stock Graph.
6. Plotting GameStop Stock Graph.

## Lessons

- The project illustrates the process of data extraction using APIs and webscraping, and creating a [pandas dataframe](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.html) from the data.
- The project shows hands-on implementation of functions in data science projects, including a sample situation where functional programming is used in a data science plotting task. 
- The project introduces the [plotly](https://plotly.com/python/) library for data visualization. You learn to hasten the process of making graphs by writing reusable functions, and the process of making graphs for stock data visualization.
- The project illustrates the basics of getting finance market data using [yfinance](https://pypi.org/project/yfinance/). [yfinance](https://pypi.org/project/yfinance/) provides a means to access finance market data from [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/) for analysis. 
- The project illustrates the basics of webscraping using [requests](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and [Beautiful Soup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/).
